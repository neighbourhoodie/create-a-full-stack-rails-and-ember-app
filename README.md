Ember.js is a powerful front-end framework for single-page applications, with a recent major upgrade to version 2. Ruby on Rails is one of the oldest and most popular back-end frameworks. Both emphasize developer ergonomics and favour an approach of convention over configuration. So it's natural that we would pair them in a full-stack application! This is even more practical since Rails API has been bundled with the new Rails 5.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will show you how to combine a Rails back-end and Ember front-end into a powerful, modern full-stack app. During this course, you'll build a full-featured customer relationship management (CRM) app. Along the way, you'll learn how to build a REST API in Ruby on Rails, with OAuth authentication support. You'll also learn how to use the latest features of Ember with Handlebars templates, routing, Ember-CLI and the exciting new Ember Components functionality.
